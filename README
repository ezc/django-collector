====================
Django Collector
====================
A django application that uses a distributed method (celery) for collecting
measurements.

Just a word of warning. This project should be considered 
very UNSTABLE for the time beeing. 
There are a lot of design desitions to make and try out before anything goes stable.



Flow of things
==============
This is how it works for the moment but it will certanly change.

A process driven by celery on the server sends out requests for information
periodically based on information in the database.

A worker process on the same or other computer listen for these request,
fetches whats requested and responds.

Another process on the celery also driven by celery process these responses as
they come in and update the corresponding tables and fields in the database.
